# ./script Sign-In Form

Just a "pretty" version of a Google Form that I made for fun! Followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9BHCv2x_Pg
- same form functionalities, but a different UI to allow for extra customizability, since Google Forms is very limited design-wise
- planning to figure out how to change UI of the "Submitted Form" page and manage that redirection so it doesn't revert back to old Google Forms UI
